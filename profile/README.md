# Sunshine Project

The Sunshine Project is the name given to a project looking to spread gratitude and gratefulness to people across discord and the web. I will also be doing writeups during development on my blog.

### Purpose of this project

Mostly to spread positivity, with a side bonus of keeping skills up to date in React, CSS, HTML, Javascript and learn more about GCP and Python (Django and Discord.py).

## The stack and organization

This project will have three repos, one for the discord bot itself, one for the website, and one for the cog

### The discord bot (sunshine-bot)

This bot will be programmed using discord.py. Initial development on a discord Red Cog has already begun, which we will port over to a standalone bot while keeping the Cog up to date.

### The website (sunshine-website)

This will be a django + react project. Django will be used for the API calls to the database on GCP and for authorization using discord and will deliver the react frontend.

### The cogs (sunshine-cogs)

This will have the discord red cog inside it.

## Collaboration

Currently this project will be worked on and maintained by @ChristianMorton and @ropeadope62
